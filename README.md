## 3. Problem Statement
In emergencies, people often waste precious time searching for help numbers, explaining their location, or finding nearby hospitals and police stations. Delays in response can worsen the situation and, in extreme cases, cost lives. There is a need for a fast, simple, and reliable way to alert contacts and locate help instantly.

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
QuickHelp is a mobile application that allows users to send their live location to pre-set emergency contacts with a single tap. It also provides an instant list of nearby hospitals, police stations, and fire stations using Google Places API. The app focuses on speed, simplicity, and offline readiness for storing important numbers locally.

## 5. Key Features
- **One-Tap SOS** – Send pre-filled emergency SMS with location to up to 3 contacts.
- **Nearby Help List** – Find closest hospitals, police stations, and fire stations.
- **Click-to-Call** – Directly call emergency services from the app.
- **Custom SOS Message** – Personalize your emergency alert text.
- **Offline Contact Storage** – Access saved contacts even without internet.

## 6. Target Users / Audience
- General public for personal safety
- Travelers and tourists
- Elderly individuals living alone
- Students and professionals commuting late hours

## 7. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native  
- **Backend:** Node.js (optional for future cloud sync)  
- **Database:** MySQL (optional for cloud data storage; MVP uses local storage)  
- **APIs:** Google Maps Places API, Geolocation API  
- **Other Tools:** Expo CLI (for rapid React Native development)

## 8. Expected Outcome
A fully functional mobile application that can send an SOS alert with a live location in under 5 seconds and display nearby emergency services within seconds. The app should work on both Android and iOS with minimal setup.

## 9. Timeline (Optional)
- **Week 1:** UI/UX design and API setup  
- **Week 2:** Core SOS feature implementation  
- **Week 3:** Nearby help list integration and testing  
- **Week 4:** Final testing, bug fixes, and deployment to app stores

## 10. Additional Notes (Optional)
- The MVP will not require user accounts to keep it lightweight.  
- Future versions can include volunteer responder networks and cloud backup.  
- Google Maps Places API may require billing setup but has a free tier.
